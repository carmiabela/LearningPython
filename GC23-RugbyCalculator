#Create a scoring system for Rugby. (Rugby Union or league, your choice) This program should ask for the two team names and each Try, conversion & penalty kick should be recorded seperately, so that at the end of the game. Not only do we know the scores for the 2 teams but also how the points were scored. (25 points)

name = ['','']
points = [[0,0],[0,0]]

for i in range(2):
  a = input('wats ur team name?')
  name[i]=a

for i in range(2):
  print(name[i])
  points[i][0] = int(input("enter penalty kick points"))
  print(points[i][0])
  points[i][1] = int(input("enter conversion points"))
  print(points[i][1])

for i in range(2):
  print(name[i],"penalty points",points[i][0],"conversion points",points[i][1])
