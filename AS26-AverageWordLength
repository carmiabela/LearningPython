#A rough guide as to how difficult a document is to read is to work out word lengths. Write a program that will calculate the average word length of a text stored in a file (i.e the sum of all the lengths of the word tokens in the text, divided by the number of word tokens).




def CalculateAverage(list):
  sum = 0
  for i in range(len(list)):
    sum+= len(list[i])
  return sum/len(list)


a = input("enter sentence").split()
print(CalculateAverage(a))
