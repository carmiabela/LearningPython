#Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

while True:
  a=0
  b = int(input("enter money u want 2 exchange"))
  for i in range(300):
    if b== i*5 :
      print(f"here's ${b-0.5}")
      a=1
  if a==0:
    print("not a multiple of 5 try again")
